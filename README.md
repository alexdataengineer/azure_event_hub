## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Azure Event Hub configured (namespace: `datateam2`)
- Event Hub connection string or Azure Identity credentials

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file based on `config.example`:

```bash
cp config.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your configurations:

```env
# Option 1: Use Connection String (simpler for testing)
EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_event_hub_connection_string_here
EVENT_HUB_NAME=your_event_hub_name_here

# Option 2: Use Azure Identity (recommended for production)
# AZURE_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
# AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
# AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
# EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE=datateam2
```

### 3. Get Connection String

1. Access the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Go to your Event Hub (`datateam2`)
3. Click on "Shared access policies"
4. Select "RootManageSharedAccessKey"
5. Copy the "Connection string-primary key"

## 📤 Sending Events

### Quick Test

```bash
python quick_test.py
```

### Complete Script

```bash
python send_events.py
```

Available options:
- **1**: Send batch of events
- **2**: Send events continuously
- **3**: Send single event

## 📥 Receiving Events

```bash
python receive_events.py
```

This script will:
- Connect to Event Hub
- Listen to events in real-time
- Display details of each received event
- Use checkpoint to mark events as processed

## 📊 Event Format

Events sent follow this JSON format:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_1234567890",
  "event_type": "user_login",
  "user_id": "user_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T21:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "session_id": "sess_1234",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "page_url": "https://example.com/page/1",
    "value": 42.5
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "python-script",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "environment": "development"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Testing and Development
- Use `quick_test.py` for quick tests
- Use `send_events.py` to simulate load

### 2. Monitoring
- Use `receive_events.py` to monitor events in real-time
- Check the Data Explorer in Azure Portal

### 3. Production
- Configure Azure Identity for secure authentication
- Use consumer groups for parallel processing
- Implement retry logic and error handling

## 🔍 Checking Events in Portal

1. Access the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Go to your Event Hub (`datateam2`)
3. Click on "Data Explorer"
4. View real-time or historical events

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Connection Error
- Check if the connection string is correct
- Confirm if the Event Hub is active
- Check policy permissions

### Authentication Error
- For Azure Identity: configure environment variables
- For Connection String: check if it hasn't expired

### Events not appearing
- Check if you're using the correct consumer group
- Confirm if there are events being sent
- Use Data Explorer to verify
